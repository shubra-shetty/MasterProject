Running the CognitoSyncDemo Sample
============================================
This sample demonstrates how to use Cognito Sync client library on Android. It supports Facebook Login, Login with Amazon as well as Unauthenticated Identities.

1. Import the project CognitoSyncDemo into Eclipse
   * Go to File -> Import.  Import Wizard will open.
   * Select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.  Click Next.
   * In Select root directory, browse to samples directory.  List of all samples projects will appear.
   * Select the CognitoSyncDemo project to import
   * Click Finish.

2. Copy the AWS SDK for Android jar into the libs directory for the project. Include the following jars under libs/debug directory (for release purposes, you can include the release jars under libs/release directory)
   * aws-android-sdk-X.X.X-core.debug.jar
   * extras/aws-android-sdk-X.X.X-cognito.debug.jar

3. Update the path to the FacebookSDK in project.properties. By default it points to the one included in the repo so if you just cloned the project and didn't move any of the directories this should not be necessary. (While Facebook Login is not required to run the app, the SDK is still required to build)

4. Update your App configuration for Cognito:
   * Make sure you have an identity pool created and configured at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/ and you downloaded the starter code at the last step of the wizard.
   * Open CognitoSyncClientManager.java
   * Update "AWS_ACCOUNT_ID", "IDENTITY_POOL_ID", "UNAUTH_ROLE_ARN", and "AUTH_ROLE_ARN" with the values from the starter code.
   * At this point you can run the sample if you have the support of unauthenticated identity configured in the identity pool.
     + Go to Project ->  Clean.
     + Go to Project ->  Build All.
     + Go to Run -> Run.
   * To support Facebook Login and Login with Amazon, continue with step 4 and step 5.

5. To add support for Facebook Login (Optional)
   * Follow the instructions at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/ to create a Facebook app
     + For "Package Name", enter com.amazonaws.cognito.sync.demo
     + For "Class Name", enter com.amazonaws.cognito.sync.demo.MainActivity
   * Make sure your identity pool is configured to support Facebook login by entering the Facebook app ID at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/ from the previous step.
   * Import the Facebook SDK into Eclipse following https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/
   * Link to the Facebook SDK project and configure the Facebook app ID
     + Open the strings.xml file located in res/values
     + Update "facebook_app_id" with the app ID of the app you created
     + Open project properties and under Android remove the placeholder Facebook library "path/to/facebook/sdk" and add "FacebookSDK"
   * At this point you can run the sample with Facebook Login.

6. To add support for Login with Amazon. (Optional)
   * Follow the instructions at https://login.amazon.com/android to register a new application
     + For "Label", enter Cognito sync demo
     + For "Package Name", enter com.amazonaws.cognito.sync.demo
   * Make sure your identity pool is configured to support Login with Amazon by entering the Client ID at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/ from the previous step.
   * Copy and paste the API key to assets/api_key.txt
   * If this isn't configured properly, the "Login with Amazon" button will be disabled in the sample app.
