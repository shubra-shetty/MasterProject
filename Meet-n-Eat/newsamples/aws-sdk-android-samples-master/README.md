###Help
##### The sample can no longer be compiled/imported if I move it to another directory
* We typically include the dependencies in the repo and have them already
linked, so if you move the project you'll need to also update the path to the
dependency. To do this, modify the project.properties file of the project

##### How do I use a different version of an included library(such as the Facebook SDK)?
* Change the path to the library in project.properties of the project you are
building to be the path to the version you want

##### I'm getting an error saying that there are multiple versions of a jar
* To fix this, make sure that all the jars you are using conform to the same
version. You can do this by just replacing all the problematic jars with the
version you would like to use.

##### Where do I find login-with-amazon-sdk.jar?
* The jar is usually already included where required. However, if not or if you want to use a different version, you can find it <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/engage/login-with-amazon/docs/install_sdk_android.html">here</a>.
